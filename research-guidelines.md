# Research Quality Guidelines

## Source Quality Standards

### Primary Sources (Strongly Preferred)
- Official company website pages: About, Careers, Products, Press, Investor Relations
- Direct product documentation and technical specs
- Official company blog posts and announcements
- Verified social media accounts (company-owned)
- SEC filings and investor materials
- Company-published case studies and whitepapers

### Acceptable Secondary Sources
- Major news outlets (Bloomberg, Reuters, WSJ, TechCrunch, The Verge, etc.)
- Industry analyst reports (Gartner, Forrester, IDC)
- Reputable tech publications with editorial standards
- App store listings (Apple App Store, Google Play Store) for product details
- LinkedIn company profiles for employee counts and leadership
- Crunchbase or similar databases for funding and basic facts

### Sources to Avoid
- Unverified blogs without clear authorship
- AI-generated content summaries
- User forums or Reddit posts (unless specifically for user sentiment)
- Wikipedia (acceptable for quick orientation only, not for citations)
- Sponsored content or advertorials
- Sites with clear bias or agenda

## Citation Standards

### Format
Use this format throughout: [Website Name | Page Title](url)

**Examples:**
- [Google | About Us](https://about.google.com)
- [TechCrunch | Startup X Raises $50M](https://techcrunch.com/article)
- [Apple App Store | Product Name](https://apps.apple.com/app/...)

### Inline Citations
- Cite sources immediately after the claim in each section
- One citation per distinct claim or set of related facts
- If multiple sources support the same claim, cite the strongest source

### Complete Source List
- Number all sources sequentially (1, 2, 3...)
- Include every source used anywhere in the document
- Maintain consistent formatting

## Research Process Best Practices

### Multi-Source Verification
- For key claims (revenue, employee count, major milestones), verify across multiple sources
- Flag any conflicting information found between sources
- Default to official company sources when discrepancies exist

### Temporal Awareness
- Note the date of information when it may change (employee count, revenue, etc.)
- Prioritize recent sources (within last 12 months) for dynamic information
- Historical facts (founding date, major acquisitions) can use older sources

### Product-Specific Research
- When a product URL is provided, focus research on that specific product
- For companies with multiple products, clearly distinguish between company-wide and product-specific information
- Gather product details from: product landing pages, documentation, app stores, user reviews, product demos

### Depth vs. Breadth
- Aim for 8-15 quality sources per company
- Better to have fewer high-quality sources than many low-quality ones
- For complex products, may need 15-20+ sources
- Stop research when you have comprehensive, verified answers to all sections

## Handling Missing Information

### When Official Info is Limited
1. Search for press releases or news coverage
2. Check app stores or product directories
3. Look for analyst reports or industry databases
4. Review social media announcements
5. If still not found, explicitly note: "Information not publicly available"

### What NOT to Do
- Do not speculate or infer facts without evidence
- Do not use placeholder text like "approximately" without a source
- Do not cite vague sources like "various reports" or "industry sources"
- Do not fill gaps with generic industry statements

## Section-Specific Guidelines

### Mission & Values
- Extract exact wording when available
- If not explicitly stated, note: "Not explicitly published" rather than inferring
- Look in: About page, Careers page, Annual reports, Investor decks

### Key Facts
- Verify numbers across multiple sources when possible
- Use ranges when exact figures unavailable (e.g., "500-1,000 employees")
- Note data recency: "As of [date]"

### Products
- List ALL major products/services, not just the one in the URL
- For the URL-specified product, provide significantly more detail
- Distinguish between: core products, legacy products, beta/upcoming products

### Industry & Market
- Use industry-standard terminology (e.g., "SaaS," "B2B," "Fintech")
- Identify specific niche or category (not just "technology company")
- Support market position claims with evidence

### Customer Insights
- Prefer named customers over vague segments
- Use case studies when available
- Note if customer information is limited (many companies don't publish this)
