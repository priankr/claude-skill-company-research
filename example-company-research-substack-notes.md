## 1. Company Mission

**Official Mission Statement:**

"Make it simple to start a publication that makes money from subscriptions."

The company's stated goal reflects its commitment to empowering independent creators to build sustainable businesses through direct relationships with their audiences. Substack positions itself as "a new economic engine for culture" that enables creators to focus on serving their audience rather than chasing clicks or appeasing advertisers.

The founders launched Substack in 2017 because they wanted the internet to be better for writers and readers, dismayed by clickbait, content farms, and the cheap outrage fostered by the attention economy.

## 5. Product Deep Dive: Substack Notes

### 5.1. How Substack Notes Works

**Core Functionality:**

Notes is a feature where writers can publish short-form posts and share ideas with each other and their readers. Through Notes, writers can share posts, links, images, quotes, and comments with their subscribers and the greater Substack network.

**Key Features:**

1. **Short-Form Posting:** Users can share quick thoughts, links, quotes, and images, or highlight parts of their own (or others') posts in a familiar timeline format with likes, reposts, and replies.

2. **Restacking:** Similar to retweeting, "restacking" allows users to share Substack posts or other Notes, appearing as a clickable image and headline.

3. **Mentions:** Users can mention other Substack users by typing @ and their name.

4. **Quote Sharing:** Readers can highlight sections of text from Substack posts and share them as Notes with the 'Restack quote' feature.

5. **Engagement Metrics:** Writers can view stats including likes, comments, restacks, clicks, new followers, and new subscribers generated from each Note.

6. **Reply Controls:** When composing a note, creators can select who can reply: everyone or only paid subscribers.

7. **Algorithmic Distribution:** Notes may be shown to subscribers and followers, to the network of people who engage with the Notes, and algorithmically to anyone else who may like them.

**How Users Interact:**

On desktop, users access Notes by clicking their profile icon and selecting Notes from the dropdown menu. On mobile, users tap the Home tab in the Substack Reader app. Notes are public and can appear on the web, in the Substack app, and on a user's Substack profile.

### 5.2. What Problems Substack Notes Solves

**1. Discovery Challenge**

Notes is designed to drive discovery across Substack, giving writers the ability to recommend almost anything and find new audiences as interactions travel through the network. Unlike traditional newsletters that require email opt-ins, Notes provides an always-on discovery engine.

**2. Engagement Between Long-Form Content**

Notes offer a less formal space to let authentic voice shine through and foster more frequent community interaction beyond scheduled newsletter posts.

**3. Platform Dependence on Social Media**

Notes serves as an alternative to traditional social media platforms, running on a subscription network rather than ads, where the lifeblood is the money paid to people doing worthy work. The timing of the Notes launch aligned with uncertainty around Twitter, providing creators with an integrated social-media-like feature within the Substack ecosystem.

**4. Subscriber Conversion**

Notes acts as a marketing funnel, exposing creators' voices to new audiences without cluttering inboxes, helping convert casual readers into followers and eventually subscribers.

**5. Community Building**

Notes enables writers to foster vibrant community interaction through quick updates, behind-the-scenes content, and real-time conversations.

### 5.3. Recent Updates and Evolution

**Launch Timeline:**

- Notes was announced on April 5, 2023, and became available to all writers and readers on April 11, 2023.

**Algorithm Evolution:**

- In 2024, Substack began distributing Notes to people who are not directly connected to the creator, showing Notes from writers and readers whose content has been interacted with by those you follow or subscribe to. This expanded discovery beyond immediate networks.

**Distribution Expansion:**

- The algorithm boosts engagement-driven Notes, meaning thoughtful content often travels further than simple self-promotion.

**Platform Integration:**

Notes is fully integrated across all Substack platforms—web browser, mobile app, and user profiles—ensuring consistent access and experience.

### 5.4. Followers vs. Subscribers Model

**Key Distinction:**

Subscribers receive emails and may see Notes in their feed, while Followers only see Notes in their feed without receiving emails. Followers represent people higher up in the marketing funnel who may not be ready to subscribe yet.

This two-tier system allows creators to build audience relationships at different commitment levels.

## 6. Industry and Market

**Industry:** Digital Publishing & Creator Economy / Subscription-Based Media Platform

**Market Position:**

Substack operates as a subscription-based content management platform for publishers in the B2C, B2B, and SaaS space within the Media & Entertainment market segment. The company has positioned itself as a leader in the independent publishing movement, championing a direct-to-consumer subscription model over advertising-based revenue.

**Market Context:**

The platform emerged during a significant shift in media economics. The founders saw that the media business was in bad shape—Craigslist disrupted newspaper classifieds, while Google and Facebook dominated the ads business, leading to newspaper shutdowns and journalist layoffs. By late 2020, many journalists were joining Substack, driven by the long-term decline in traditional media (with half as many newsroom jobs in 2019 as in 2004).

Substack has more than 4 million paid subscribers, exceeding prominent sites like The Wall Street Journal (3.8 million), The Washington Post (2.5 million), and Medium (1 million).

**Competition:**

Key competitors in the newsletter and creator platform space include:

- **Ghost** — An open-source alternative offering more customization, no transaction fees, and powerful membership tools.
- **Beehiiv** — A newsletter platform with strong growth features including referral programs, automated sequences, and an ad network, with no percentage fees on memberships.
- **Kit (ConvertKit)** — Creator-focused email platform with automation features, digital product sales, and a creator network for audience growth.
- **Medium** — Blogging platform with built-in audience discovery and SEO advantages, offering a different monetization model through the Partner Program.
- **Patreon** — Membership platform for creator support across various content types
- **MailerLite, Brevo, GetResponse** — Traditional email marketing platforms expanding into newsletter monetization

Substack has 320 active competitors, including 29 funded companies, and ranks 2nd in terms of total funding among them.

## 8. Pricing Model

**For Creators (Publishers):**

Publishing is free on Substack—no matter how many subscribers you have.

**When enabling paid subscriptions, the following fees apply:**

- **Platform Fee:** Substack takes a 10% platform fee on all paid transactions
- **Payment Processing:** Stripe charges a credit card fee of 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
- **Billing Fee:** A 0.7% billing fee for recurring subscriptions (as of July 2024)

**Combined Fees:** Approximately 13%-16% total fees, meaning a $5/month subscriber nets the creator about $4.39

**Subscription Pricing Requirements:**

- **Minimum Price:** As of 2020, the minimum subscription fee was $5/month or $30/year
- **Standard Pricing:** The most common price publications charge is $5/month or $50/year
- **Flexibility:** Creators set their own monthly, annual, and founding member plan prices

**Pricing Tiers Typically Offered:**

1. **Free Tier:** All newsletters can offer free content

3. **Annual Subscription:** Typically $50/year, representing a 17% discount from monthly
4. **Founding Member:** Often priced at $100-500/year with added rewards for superfans

**Revenue Share Philosophy:**

Substack's model is transparent: creators pay only when they earn. The 10% commission represents a revenue-sharing structure rather than upfront costs. While this might seem significant, Substack handles hosting, payment processing, and technical aspects, making it a relatively small price for the convenience.

**For Readers:**

The Substack app is free. The only cost is if readers want to access premium content and become paid subscribers to a publication. Substack won't charge readers any additional fees beyond the subscription price set by the creator.

**Special Programs:**

- **Substack Pro:** An invite-only program for highest-earning creators offering advances, more personal service, and sometimes different rates.
- **Writer Advances:** In 2020, Substack offered up to $400,000 in advance payments to popular journalists, and provided grants of $1,000-$3,000 to over 40 writers to begin on the platform.

**Payment Methods:**

Readers can pay via major credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express), Apple Pay, and in some regions, direct debit methods like SEPA Direct, iDEAL, Bancontact, and Sofort.

## 9. Insights for Applicants

### 1. **Understand the Mission Beyond the Product:**

Substack isn't just building software—it's championing an ideological shift in how content is funded. The founders believed the media world needed an alternative to online advertising and saw direct payments between readers and writers as a better path forward. In interviews, demonstrate understanding of this mission and how your role would support the vision of making subscriptions the new economic model for culture. Show you appreciate the difference between building for creators versus building for advertisers.

### 2. **Emphasize Creator-First Thinking:**

The entire company is dedicated to making it possible for publishers to earn a living doing what they love. When discussing your experience, focus on times you've prioritized user/creator needs, built tools that increased creator success, or advocated for features that gave users more control. Highlight work where you measured success by creator outcomes rather than just platform metrics.

### 3. **Demonstrate Cultural Values Alignment:**

The company takes strong positions on content moderation and free expression. Substack believes in the free press and free speech, and doesn't believe these can be decoupled. While you don't need to agree with every company position, be prepared to discuss how you'd navigate the balance between safety and freedom of expression. Show thoughtfulness about these tensions rather than oversimplifying.

### 4. **Show Understanding of the Subscription Economy:**

The platform runs on paid subscriptions, not ads, which changes everything—people get rewarded for respecting the trust and attention of their audiences. Prepare examples of how you've worked with or understand subscription business models, retention metrics, creator monetization, or direct-to-consumer relationships. Explain how these differ from ad-based models and why that matters.

### 5. **Highlight Growth and Discovery Expertise (Especially for Product Roles):**

More than 50% of all subscriptions originate from within the Substack platform. The company has invested heavily in discovery features like Notes and Recommendations. If applying for product, engineering, or growth roles, emphasize experience with network effects, discovery algorithms, recommendation systems, or community features that drive organic growth. Be ready to discuss Notes specifically and ideas for its evolution.

### 6. **Prepare for Questions About Scale and Impact:**

With over 17,000 writers earning money and the top 10 making more than $40 million per year, Substack operates at significant scale while maintaining a relatively lean team. As of the Y Combinator profile, Substack had 90 employees. Be ready to discuss how you've achieved impact with limited resources, and how you prioritize when you can't build everything.

### 7. **Know the Competitive Landscape:**

Key competitors like Ghost, Beehiiv, and Kit offer different value propositions—Ghost emphasizes ownership and customization, Beehiiv focuses on growth tools, and Kit offers powerful automation. In interviews, show awareness of what makes Substack different: its network effects, integrated ecosystem, and focus on creator independence. Be prepared to discuss how Substack should respond to competitive pressure.

### 8. **Understand the Criticism and Challenges:**

The platform has faced scrutiny. Substack has faced criticism for its hands-off approach to content moderation, with concerns about misinformation, extremist rhetoric, and conspiracy theories. In November 2023, over 100 creators threatened to leave over concerns about white nationalists and antisemites using the platform. Don't avoid these topics—show you understand the nuances and can think through difficult tradeoffs between principles and practical concerns.
