# Company Research Claude Skill

---

A comprehensive Claude Skill for conducting professional company and product research. Generates structured reports ideal for competitive analysis, market research, and job interview preparation.

## Context

Traditionally, researching a company has been a tedious and time-consuming process. It can be challenging to find all the critical details and locate reliable sources. While we can use AI to enhance this process, since research is often done ad hoc, using different tools and approaches, the results can be inconsistent, varying in quality. This project explores how AI can be used to create a fully automated company research workflow by creating a Claude Skill. This skill was created to address the need for consistent, high-quality company research. It standardizes the process while maintaining depth and quality.

This skill can be helpful in three key scenarios:

1. **Job Search Preparation** - Research companies before interviews, understand culture and values, and prepare talking points.
2. **Competitive Analysis** - Analyze competitors' products, positioning, and market strategy
3. **Market Research** - Understanding industry players or evaluating potential customers, partners, or investment targets

**Note:**The research reports generated by this Claude Skill are meant to be a **starting point**. You have to ensure you review and refine the output for your specific use case. Also, since these reports are AI-generated, always check for inconsistencies, hallucinations, and errors in the reports.

## Limitations
- **Information Availability:** Private companies may have limited public information, so some details (like revenue, employee count) may be unavailable.
- **Subjective Analysis:** Skill focuses on factual research, not strategic recommendations, so it won't provide specific advice (e.g., “Should I partner with this company?”).
- **Research Depth vs. Time:** Thorough research takes 5-10 minutes per company, so this may not be suitable for quick, superficial overviews.
- **Technical Products:** Deeply technical products (enterprise software, developer tools) may require additional technical expertise to fully evaluate, so hands-on evaluation and review of technical documentation may be necessary.
- **Language Support:** Optimized for English-language sources, so research quality may be reduced for companies whose information is not available in English.

## Customization Guide

**Note:** See [skill-customization-guide.md](https://github.com/priankr/claude-skill-company-research/blob/main/skill-customization-guide.md) for how to modify the skill for your specific needs.
